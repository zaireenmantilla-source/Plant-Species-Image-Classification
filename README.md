# Plant-Image-Classification

---

### A. Project Overview

**Brief description of the project**

The project focuses on classifying different plant species using image recognition technology through Teachable Machine. It aims to automatically identify plants based on their visual features such as leaf shape, color, texture, and structure. By collecting and training a dataset of plant images, the system learns patterns that help distinguish one plant species from another. Once trained, the model can analyze new plant images and accurately predict their classification.

**Purpose of the image classification model**

The purpose of the image classification model in this project is to automatically identify and categorize different plant species based on their visual characteristics such as leaf shape, color, texture, and size using Teachable Machine.

## Reflection Questions:

### **1. How did the number of images per class affect your model’s accuracy?**

The number of images per class greatly affected the model’s accuracy. Classes with more images were recognized more accurately because the model had more examples to learn from. Classes with fewer images had lower accuracy since the model had limited data to understand their features.

### **2. Which plant species were most commonly misclassified and why?**

Plant species with similar leaf shapes, colors, or textures were most commonly misclassified. For example, plants with similar green leaves or similar patterns confused the model because their visual features looked alike. Poor lighting and unclear images also contributed to misclassification.

### **3. How did changing the epochs, batch size, or learning rate affect the training results?**

If the epochs were increased, the model had more time to learn and accuracy improved, but too many epochs could cause overfitting. Changing the batch size affected how fast the model trained and how stable the learning process was. Adjusting the learning rate impacted how quickly the model updated its weights—too high caused unstable results, while too low made training slower.

### **4. What challenges did you encounter during dataset collection and labeling?**

Some challenges included collecting enough clear images for each plant species, maintaining consistent lighting and background, and properly labeling the images. Similar-looking plants also made it difficult to ensure correct classification.

### **5. If you were to improve your model, what specific changes would you make and why?**

To improve the model, I would collect more high-quality images for each class, especially for plants with fewer samples. I would also ensure consistent backgrounds and lighting. Additionally, I would try adjusting training settings such as increasing epochs and organizing the dataset more carefully to improve overall accuracy and reduce misclassification.
